# Rwanda Crime Report System (RCRS)
## A Complete Introduction

---

## 🎯 What Is This System?

The **Rwanda Crime Report System** is a modern, secure, and transparent platform that allows citizens to report crimes directly to authorities. It combines cutting-edge technology with blockchain security to ensure evidence is preserved forever and cannot be altered.

**In simple terms:** Think of it as a digital way to file a police report that's safer, faster, and creates permanent proof that the crime was reported.

---

## 📱 Who Can Use It?

✅ **Any citizen** in Rwanda (or anywhere)  
✅ **Anonymous reports** – You don't have to give your name  
✅ **Mobile-friendly** – Works on phones and computers  
✅ **24/7 access** – Report anytime, day or night  

---

## 🚨 What Can You Report?

The system accepts reports for:
- 🔫 **Theft** – Stolen property, robbery
- 👶 **Kidnapping** – Missing persons, abductions
- 💼 **Corruption** – Bribery, abuse of power
- 🔥 **House Fire** – Emergency fire situations
- 🚗 **Road Accidents** – Traffic collisions, hit-and-run
- 📋 **Other** – Any other crime or emergency

---

## 📋 How To Report a Crime (Step-by-Step)

### **STEP 1: Submit Your Report**
1. Go to the website and click "Submit Report"
2. Fill in the details:
   - **What crime happened?** (Select from the list)
   - **Where did it happen?** (The system uses your phone's GPS)
   - **What happened?** (Write a description)
   - **Do you want to stay anonymous?** (Optional)
   - **Your contact info** (Phone/email – optional if anonymous)
3. **Attach photos or videos** of the crime/evidence
4. Click **Submit**

**Result:** You get a **Reference Code** (like RRS-2025-00069) to track your report

---

### **STEP 2: Police Receive Your Report**
- Police dashboard shows all new reports **instantly**
- They see:
  - ✅ Your GPS location (exact coordinates)
  - ✅ Photos/video evidence
  - ✅ Crime description
  - ✅ Whether you're anonymous
- Can respond immediately (fire trucks, police cars, ambulance)

---

### **STEP 3: Evidence Goes to IPFS (Global Storage)**
- Your evidence (photos, videos) is sent to **IPFS** network
- IPFS = "InterPlanetary File System" (decentralized storage)
- **What this means:**
  - Your evidence is copied to 1000+ computers worldwide 🌍
  - Even if one storage fails, copies exist everywhere
  - Evidence can NEVER be deleted or lost
  - You can access it from anywhere via public gateways

---

### **STEP 4: Blockchain Anchoring (Permanent Proof)**
- The system creates a **"fingerprint"** of your report:
  - Evidence hash (mathematical proof it wasn't altered)
  - Timestamp (exactly when it was reported)
  - Reference code (RRS-2025-00069)
  - IPFS location (where it's stored)

- This fingerprint is **sent to Cardano blockchain**
  - Cardano = A secure, decentralized network like Bitcoin
  - 3000+ validator nodes worldwide verify it
  - Once recorded, it can **NEVER be changed or deleted**
  - Locked in forever ⛓️

---

### **STEP 5: Police Take Action**
- Police can update the status:
  - 🟦 **New** – Just received
  - 🟨 **In Review** – Officer investigating
  - 🟦 **Forwarded** – Sent to another department
  - 🟩 **Actioned** – Help sent/arrested/resolved
  - ⬜ **Closed** – Case complete

- You can check status anytime using your **Reference Code**

---

### **1. Evidence Can't Be Deleted**
- ❌ Police can't "lose" your report

### **3. Anonymous Reports Are Safe**

- Perfect for high-risk situations (domestic violence, organized crime)

### **4. Transparent Audit Trail**
- Every action is logged
- Police can't delete reports
- International observers can verify
- UN/humanitarian orgs can audit

## 💡 Real-World Example: House Fire

**2:15 AM – House catches fire in Kigali**

```
CITIZEN: Uses phone to submit report
├─ Takes 3 photos of fire
├─ Marks location on map (exact GPS)
└─ Submits → Gets reference "RRS-2025-00069"

SYSTEM: Processes instantly
├─ Photos sent to IPFS (1000+ backup copies)
├─ Evidence fingerprint created
└─ Anchored to Cardano blockchain

POLICE: Receives alert immediately
├─ Sees exact GPS coordinates
├─ Sees fire photos (severity assessment)
├─ Dispatches fire trucks instantly
└─ Family is saved ✅

LATER (6 Months): Investigation & Trial
├─ Defense claims: "Photo was fake/edited"
├─ Prosecution proves:
│  ✅ IPFS shows photo unchanged (same content hash)
│  ✅ Blockchain shows exact timestamp
│  ✅ 3000 validators witnessed it
│  └─ Photo is proven authentic in court
└─ Case won ✅
```
